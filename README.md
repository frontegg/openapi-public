<h3 align="center">Frontegg's OpenAPI Specifications</h3>
</div>

## OpenAPI Specifications 

This repository provides the OpenAPI specifications for all our services in one place, ensuring you have access to the latest API definitions for integration and development.

## Combined OpenAPI Specification

In this repository, you'll find a file named `combined.json`, which consolidates the OpenAPI specifications of all our services into a single document.  

This file is especially useful if you want to generate a client library to interact with multiple APIs from your backend or other applications. By using `combined.json`, you can streamline development and avoid managing separate OpenAPI files for each service.
